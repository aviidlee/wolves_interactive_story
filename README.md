## Description 
This is an interactive, branching short story written using Inkle's utility Inky. 

The story is best enjoyed by those with some experience playing fantasy RPG games such as The Witcher series,
and will be slightly funnier for those you have some understanding of programming. Some of the jokes are a little
obscure. However, I hope that the meat of the story is still enjoyable for everyone. 

## Development status 
The story is currently incomplete, and has bugs. If you find any bugs, grammar issues, spelling mistakes,
puncutation, please let me know. For now, please do NOT tell me anything about formatting issues.
